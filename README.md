=====

KUBES is an interactive installation that lets you create sound and light effects with your body.

The user is placed in front of a water tanks wall. By simple gestures he can light the tanks by starting loops, playing notes or creating nice sound effects.

KUBES is an adaptation of flashcubes, a light creation by artist designer Benjamin Pailhe.
